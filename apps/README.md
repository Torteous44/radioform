# apps/

Application layer for Radioform across different platforms and deployment targets.

## Contents

- **mac/**: macOS SwiftUI menu bar application
- **web/**: Marketing website and documentation site

Each subdirectory contains its own README with build and run instructions.

## Note

The driver and audio host are located in `packages/` instead of here, as they are core build components rather than standalone applications.
